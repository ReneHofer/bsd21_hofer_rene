# JUnit Testing

## testAdd

This first test takes two integer values (2,3) which are used for the Calculator.add method and assigns the result to the variable result. This variable is then compared to the number "5".

## testAdd2

The second test method for the Calculator.add method assigns the sum of value1 and value2 to the variable "result". The assert.Equals method then compares this variable to the return value of Calculator.add(value1, value2).

## testMinus

This test takes two integer values (5,3) which are used for the Calculator.minus method and assigns the result to the variable result. This variable is then compared to the number "2" via the assertTrue method.

## testMinus2

The second test method for the Calculator.minus method assigns the difference of value1 and value2 to the variable "result". The assert.Equals method then compares this variable to the return value of Calculator.minus(value1, value2).

## testDivide

This test takes two double values (10,5) which are used for the Calculator.divide method and assigns the result to the variable result. This variable is then compared to the number "2" via the assertTrue method.

## testDivide2

The second test method for the Calculator.divide method assigns the quotient of value1 and value2 to the variable "result". The assert.Equals method then compares this variable to the return value of Calculator.divide(value1, value2).

## testMultiply

This test takes two double values (2,5) which are used for the Calculator.multiply method and assigns the result to the variable result. This variable is then compared to the number "10" via the assertTrue method.

## testMultiply2

The second test method for the Calculator.multiply method assigns the product of value1 and value2 to the variable "result". The assert.Equals method then compares this variable to the return value of Calculator.multiply(value1, value2).
