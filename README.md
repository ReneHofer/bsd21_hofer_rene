# Encryption

Encryption is a java program to de- and encrypt your text input. It uses a ceasar cipher and rotates characters by a certain number, choosen by the user.  

## Installation

No installation is required for this program. You may open Encryption in a Java Development Enviroment of your choice.

## Usage

The menu includes three different options (encrypt, decrypt and quit). You can select any option by typing the corresponding number (1, 2 or 9 respectivly). If you select either the encrypt or decrypt option, you will then be asked to choose a number by which the text will be rotated. Lastly you will be asked to enter the text you want to have en- or decyrpted. After pressing enter,  the console will then show your en- or decrypted text. After a successful en- or decyrption, the menu will show up on the console again. You will be able to exit the program by using the quit option in the menu.
